<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FRANKIE'S NEW TEACHER.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> little Frankie Gray was
nearly seven years old, a lady
came to reside in the town where
he lived, hoping to collect a
small school.</p>

<p>Frankie's mother called upon
her, and was so much pleased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
with her frank, cheerful manners,
her sunny smile, and her Christian
conversation, that she promised,
with her husband's consent,
to send Frankie and Nelly to be
her pupils.</p>

<p>The young teacher's name was
Fanny Grant. Nelly laughed
merrily when she heard it, and
said she should always think of
her great doll, Fanny, when she
saw her.</p>

<p>Papa had for a long time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
feared it was an injury to his
wife to be confined so many
hours as she thought it necessary
to be in order to attend to
the children's studies, and he was
very glad to find a good teacher
for them.</p>

<p>Miss Grant hired a pleasant
room in a house only a short
distance from Mr. Gray's. Then
she commenced furnishing it to
suit her own fancy. First she
fastened white shades to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
windows, and then hung the
walls with bright colored maps,
and large pictures of animals and
birds. On one side there was
a nice blackboard, and next it
a card containing the alphabet
in large letters.</p>

<p>When all this was arranged,
Miss Grant engaged a carpenter
to work for her a day in
making a gallery of four steps,
and in drawing a large circle
on the floor, which he marked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
by driving in large brass headed
nails.</p>

<p>Nelly and her cousin, who had
watched these arrangements with
great interest, were very curious
to know their use. The teacher,
smiling, bade them wait and see.</p>

<p>"Is all ready now?" asked
Frankie.</p>

<p>"Not quite," said the teacher.
"I must have some small chairs
for my little scholars; also some
more apparatus."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is apparatus?" inquired
Nelly.</p>

<p>"It is any thing by which we
can illustrate or explain our
ideas. This blackboard, and
these cards, are apparatus. You
will see, when school begins, how
I shall explain to you many
things by their help. Then I
have a large globe, a numeral
frame, and an orrery."</p>

<p>"I had an orrery once," shouted
Frankie. "It was made of wire,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
with potatoes and turnips. Is
yours like that?"</p>

<p>"O, no," said the teacher, with
a hearty laugh. "The planets
are made of wood, or plaster,
and painted very prettily."</p>

<p>"I shall like to see it," said
Frankie.</p>

<p>"So shall I," said Nelly.</p>

<p>The children then took their
leave, after bidding the lady good
by; but presently Frankie returned,
all out of breath, to say,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
"Miss Grant, I have a whole box
of beautiful great cards. They
were my birthday present from
papa and mamma. You may
take them, if you want to, and
hang them around the room."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my little friend,"
said the teacher, giving him a
kiss. "I am going now to my
boarding place, and you may
walk with me, if you can stop
until I put on my bonnet."</p>

<p>"I should like that," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Frankie. "I'll run out and tell
Nelly to wait."</p>

<p>Miss Grant locked the door,
and taking a small vase in her
hand, joined the children who
were waiting near the gate.</p>

<p>"What is that flower pot for?"
asked Nelly.</p>

<p>"When school begins, I shall
beg some flowers from the lady
where I live," answered the
teacher. "I like to have the
room look cheerful and bright,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
so that the little scholars will
like to be there."</p>

<p>"I wish Monday would come
quick," exclaimed the boy. "I
want to begin to go to school.
I mean to carry a great big bouquet,
out of my own garden.
Did you know I had a garden,
Miss Grant?"</p>

<p>"No, I did not; but I am very
glad to hear it. I love flowers
almost as well as I do good little
boys and girls."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should think you would
love your mother better than
either. I do."</p>

<p>Miss Grant's lip quivered, and
tears gushed to her eyes. "I do
love my mother," she said, softly,
"but she is in heaven."</p>

<p>"I'm real sorry," said the
sympathizing child, affectionately
kissing the hand he held. "If
you were little, like Nelly and
me, mother would let you be
her daughter, I guess."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>When the children reached
home, Mrs. Gray was most happy
to see what an influence the
young teacher had already established
over them. She encouraged
their love for her, and
appealed to their sympathies by
saying, "She is an orphan, without
father or mother; we must
all try to make her forget her
sorrows by showing her that she
has still many warm friends."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ONE DAY AT SCHOOL.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">I suppose</span> you will wish to
know how Frankie and Nelly
liked their new school, and
whether they continued to love
their teacher.</p>

<p>In answer to these questions,
I shall give you an account of a
day they passed about a week
after the school commenced.</p>

<p>It was a lovely morning in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
June. After breakfast and prayers
in the family of Mr. Gray,
Frankie ran out into the garden
to gather a bouquet for his
teacher. He and Nelly kept
her vase well filled with flowers.
He put the bouquet into a pitcher
of water to keep it fresh, and
then ran to the sink to wash his
face and hands very clean; after
which he went into the nursery
for Sally to pin on a clean collar,
and to brush his hair.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>While she was doing this, he
called out to his mother, who
was in the next room, "Mamma,
mayn't I learn to part my
hair myself? I'm almost seven,
you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," she answered.
"You may learn as soon as you
please. Sally will show you how
to hold the comb to make the
parting straight."</p>

<p>"I wish my hair would lie
down," exclaimed the boy, giving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the brush a quick, impatient
jerk. It curls up so close, I
can't make it look smooth. And
he brushed the front lock with
all his strength.</p>

<p>"There, now, that looks well
enough," said nurse in a comforting
tone. "You might as
well try to keep the wind from
blowing as to try to keep your
hair from curling. It will form
little rings, do all you can."</p>

<p>"Now I'm ready!" shouted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Frankie, taking his bouquet in
his hand.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Nelly had
been to her aunt's room, and
had her long hair combed out
smoothly, and then brushed over
the curling stick. It was quite
a tedious operation, and required
to be very wet before the comb
could be passed through it; but
Nelly bore it patiently, as her
aunt always tried to pass the
time away agreeably, by giving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
her some easy example in arithmetic,
or hearing a line of the
multiplication table, or telling
her a short story. By the time
this was done, Sally had turned
the mattress; and the little girl
made up her bed, laying on the
sheets and counterpane very
smoothly, so that not a rumple
could be seen. Then she hung
up such of her clothes as were
lying about the room, put her
shoes into the bag on the inside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of the closet door, then dressed
herself in a clean apron, and was
ready, by the time Frankie called,
to take the flowers Willie had
gathered for her, and walk out
with him to meet their dear
teacher.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when they were
early, they went as far as the
house where she boarded, and
stood at the gate until she appeared;
but generally they sat
down on the stone wall under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the shade of the large maple
tree at the entrance to their avenue,
and watched until she came
in sight. Then they ran eagerly
to give her their morning kiss,
and present their little offering
of flowers.</p>

<p>On this pleasant June morning,
they each took a hand as
usual, and walked on rapidly toward
the school, talking merrily
as they went.</p>

<p>When they reached the building,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
they found nearly all the
other scholars, eighteen in number,
waiting the arrival of Miss
Grant. They went into the
school room, took off their hats
and bonnets, hung them up in
the closet, and then went quietly
to their seats on the steps, the
little ones on the lower steps,
and the others above them on
the higher.</p>

<p>When the church clock struck
nine, the teacher rang the small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
bell, when every eye was closed,
and every head was bowed for
prayer. The little voices all
joined in repeating the Lord's
Prayer, after which they sung
a verse of the hymn,&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"There is a happy land,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Far, far away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Where saints in glory stand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Bright, bright as day."</span><br />
</div>

<p>After this, they pass down
from the gallery, and march
along to their seats. For the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
next half hour the school is quite
still, while the pupils are studying
the reading and spelling lessons:
when the bell strikes again,
they march out in order to the
front of the chair where their
teacher sits.</p>

<p>As soon as one class has recited,
another is called, until every little
pupil has read and spelled.</p>

<p>When this has been done,
every face begins to brighten,
for they know what the next<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
exercise is; and they like it
very much. The largest girl
takes her place on the circle,
and the others follow her according
to their size, until they
come down to the smallest one,
who is a pretty blue-eyed little
urchin of four summers.</p>

<p>Miss Grant then strikes up a
lively tune to the words,&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"This is the way we wash our face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">This is the way we wash our face,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">This is the way we wash our face,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">So early in the morning,"&mdash;</span><br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'>each little hand is vigorously
employed in rubbing the face, as
they merrily follow each other
around the circle. As soon as
they finish one verse, they stop
a moment, to avoid being made
dizzy, and then begin again:&mdash;</div>

<div class='poem'>
"This is the way we comb our hair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">This is the way we comb our hair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">This is the way we comb our hair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">So early in the morning.</span><br />
<br />
"This is the way we brush our teeth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">This is the way we brush our teeth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">This is the way we brush our teeth,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 6em;">So early in the morning.</span><br />
<br />
"This is the way we clean our nails,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">This is the way we clean our nails,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">This is the way we clean our nails,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">So early in the morning."</span><br />
</div>

<p>After this marching and singing,
the children return to their
seats to prepare a lesson in geography,
which they recite standing
near the globe, the teacher
pointing out the places upon it.</p>

<p>Recess and the various sports
recommended by the teacher
follow, and then come arithmetic
and the numeral frame. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
is a wooden frame about a foot
square, with twelve stout wires
passing from one side to the
other. Strung on each of these
wires are twelve round stones,
about the size of marbles. With
this frame Miss Grant taught her
little scholars to add, subtract,
and multiply numbers, in the
same manner that Mrs. Gray
had taught her little pupils with
marbles.</p>

<p>At the close of the morning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
session, the children marched in
the circle again, singing five
times five are twenty-five, and
five times six are thirty, to the
tune of Yankee Doodle.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, the exercises
were quite as varied. The lessons
mostly being committed in
the morning, the children were
allowed to tell stories, which the
teacher wrote for them on the
blackboard,&mdash;or they recited
hymns and verses they had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
learned; sung, marched, and listened
to the instructions of their
teacher.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE NEW SCHOLAR.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a house near the one where
Miss Grant boarded was a little
girl whose name was Hitty Moran.
Her real name was Mehitable,
but her mother and all her
companions called her Hitty.
She belonged to a very poor
family, and as she was the
eldest of a number of children,
her mother thought she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
could not spare her to attend
school.</p>

<p>From the windows of her
chamber, Miss Grant often saw
Hitty sitting on the doorstep,
holding a large baby in her
arms. She noticed that Hitty
was always kind to her baby
brother; that she sung to him,
let him pull her long hair, and
never became impatient or fretful
with him. All this interested
the kind teacher in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
child, and she longed to be of
some use to her.</p>

<p>One day, when she was returning
from her school, she
overtook Hitty, who was carrying
a heavy basket of potatoes.
"Let me help you," said the
teacher, taking hold of the
handle.</p>

<p>As they walked along, Miss
Grant asked, "Did you ever go
to school?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am," said Hitty;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
"though I staid in a house once
where the lady's son taught me
my letters."</p>

<p>"Should you like to learn?"
asked the teacher.</p>

<p>"O, yes, ma'am; sure I should
be proud if I could read; but
mother has so much work, and
Bobby takes kindly to me, so
that she can't spare me to go
to school."</p>

<p>"I should think it could be
planned somehow for you to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
learn," said Miss Grant, kindly.
"I will go in and see your mother
this evening."</p>

<p>She did so, and talked with
Mrs. Moran of the advantage it
would be to Hitty, if she could
learn to read and write.</p>

<p>"Only think," said the lady,
"she could teach her brothers
their letters, and read them pretty
stories to keep them quiet
while you are busy at work."</p>

<p>"Feth, ma'am, sure, and I've<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
sinse enough to see the truth of
what you're saying," said the poor
mother. "Her father often gets
a paper from the ould country;
but it's little use to us, you see,
because the spelling and the
pronouncing are quite beyont
him. I've often enough wished
we could have the luck to give
one of the childer an education."</p>

<p>"Can't you spare her to go to
school a part of the time?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure, ma'am, and that's the
trouble intirely. The teachers
complain when the childer don't
be regular."</p>

<p>Just at this moment one of
the children fell down, and began
to cry so loud, that Miss
Grant took her leave. She was
in earnest about doing something
for Hitty; and she walked as
far as Mrs. Gray's, to ask her
advice about it.</p>

<p>"Why don't you allow her to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
attend your school?" inquired
the lady. "One hour in the day
would be better than nothing."</p>

<p>"I should be glad to do so, if
I thought the parents would not
object," answered the teacher.
"I think with a little trouble she
could be made to look tidy."</p>

<p>Miss Grant was not at all
rich, but when a lady is resolved
to do a kindness, she
always finds out a way. She
knew that Hitty had no dress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
suitable to wear to school. She
opened her purse after she
had reached home, and taking
out some money she had laid
by to purchase a new book, she
walked to the store, and bought
some calico to make a child's
dress.</p>

<p>On her way back she called
at Mrs. Moran's, and told her
Hitty might come to her school
every afternoon if her mother
could not spare her in the morning,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and that if her mother
would try to send her, she would
provide a new gown.</p>

<p>Mrs. Moran was very grateful
for this kindness, and promised
to get along without Hitty
whenever she could. In three
days, the little girl called for her
teacher, her face and hands so
bright, and clean, and rosy, that
you would scarcely know her.
The dress fitted charmingly, and
the grateful smile and look of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
delight with which, she regarded
herself when Miss Grant tied on
a neat apron with pockets in it,
quite repaid the lady for all her
expense and trouble.</p>

<p>Most of the scholars were kind
to Hitty, and willingly lent her
a slate, pencil, or book, when
their teacher requested it. But
one little girl, whose name I am
sorry to say was Nelly, did not
like to play with Hitty, because
she lived in such a poor house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>She was ashamed to refuse
when her teacher asked her to
show the new scholar how to
make the figures on her slate;
but she had a pout on her lips,
which Miss Grant had never seen
there before, and her voice did
not sound sweet and kind.</p>

<p>When the lady saw these
marks of pride in her beloved
pupil, it made her heart ache.
She had been so full of love to
the poor, ignorant child, and so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
anxious to do her good, that she
could not bear the thought of
any one in her school treating
Hitty unkindly. For a moment
she gazed sorrowfully in Nelly's
flushed face, saw her move away
from her new schoolmate as far
on the seat as she could, and
then she called, "Hitty, come
and sit by me."</p>

<p>Presently Frankie raised his
little fat hand, and when she
nodded to him that he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
permission to speak, he asked,
"May the new girl see me make
pictures on the blackboard?"</p>

<p>"Yes, darling," answered the
lady, rising and patting him on
his curly head. "Perhaps you
can teach her to make a picture
too."</p>

<p>"See, Hitty," said Frankie;
"this is the way to do it;" and
the dear boy stood very erect
and proud of the confidence of
his teacher.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>When Miss Grant glanced toward
Nelly, she was sorry to see
that the little girl looked angry,
that her cousin was taking so
much pains with the new girl,
and that he seemed so happy in
doing it.</p>

<p>Shall I tell you what I think
the bad spirit was whispering in
her ear? It was this: "Nelly,
your father is rich; you live in a
fine house and wear nice clothes;
you are right not to like to sit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
by Hitty, who is very poor and
ignorant."</p>

<p>Ah, my little girl, do you
remember who has given you
so many blessings? It is God;
but if you are not grateful to
him, and kind to those who are
less favored, he may take away
your father and mother, and
leave you without home or
friends.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE INJURED GIRL.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Miss Grant</span> was very much
pleased with Frankie's kindness
to Hitty; and she hoped Nelly
would see how lovely it made
him appear, and try to imitate
him.</p>

<p>When the school closed, Hitty
felt so grateful to Frankie for
showing her the figures, that she
stood by him in the closet, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
see whether she could not do
something for him. His cap was
on a low hook, where he could
reach it; but the scarf he wore
with it, was hung up higher.
Hitty saw him trying to jump
and catch the end to pull it
down, and she said quickly, "I
can reach it. I will get it for
you;" and she gave it to him
with a bright smile.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Frankie,
pleasantly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>When they were out by the
gate the scarf blew off, and Hitty
ran to pick it up, when Nelly
snatched it from her, and said,
"Let alone my cousin's things,
you ugly girl;" at the same
time she gave Hitty a rough
push to get her out of the way.</p>

<p>I do not think Nelly was so
very wicked as to wish really to
hurt the little girl, but she was
angry, because her conscience was
telling her she had done wrong.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>She heard Hitty scream, but
she ran on, pulling Frankie along,
though he urged her to go back,
and see what was the matter
with the poor girl.</p>

<p>"No, no!" she cried; "I don't
like Hitty, and I don't want to
walk with her." Then she began
to talk about Ponto, and
said she wished he would come
and carry her basket for her.</p>

<p>Almost always, when Nelly
went home from school, she and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Frankie ran up stairs to the
chamber where Mrs. Gray sat
at work; but now she proposed
that they should play in the
garden with the dog.</p>

<p>The lady heard their voices,
and wondered they did not come
in to see her before they began
to play. In about fifteen minutes
she heard some one ring the bell
at the back door, and presently
Sally came up stairs into her room,
leading a little girl by the hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Hitty, but with such a
great swelling on her forehead
that Mrs. Gray did not at first
recognize her. Her eyes were
red and swollen with crying, and
even now she could scarcely keep
back her sobs.</p>

<p>As she came in, she walked
straight across the room to the
lady, and put a note into her
hand.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray opened it, and read
with great sorrow the following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
words: "Nelly pushed this little
girl against the stone post, at
the school house gate. I am
exceedingly grieved, and as I
cannot see Nelly to-night, I
have sent Hitty to you. Please
do what you think best in the
case."</p>

<p>"Come here, poor child," said
the lady, tenderly; "that is a
dreadful bunch on your forehead.
How did it happen?"</p>

<p>"I was picking up your little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
boy's scarf when it fell off his
neck, and Nelly snatched it away,
and pushed me so hard that I
fell against the post. She called
me names, too;" and Hitty began
to sob again.</p>

<p>"What did Frankie do?" asked
his mamma.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all, ma'am. It's
very kind to me, he was."</p>

<p>The lady bade the child sit
down. She then went to the
closet and poured some arnica<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
from a bottle into a bowl of
water, and after wetting a cloth
in it, bound it upon the forehead
of the child. Then she rang the
bell, and sent Margie to find
Nelly and bring her into the
house.</p>

<p>While she was waiting, she
talked with Hitty, and soon became
as much interested in her
as the teacher had been.</p>

<p>Presently Nelly came in, followed
by her cousin. She started<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and blushed when she saw Hitty;
but Frankie ran to the little
girl, asking, "What is the matter
with your head? Have you hurt
yourself?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Hitty; "she did
it," pointing to Nelly.</p>

<p>"Look here," said her aunt,
raising the cloth and pointing
to the swelling, which was half
as large as an egg.</p>

<p>Frankie exclaimed, "O, dear!
I'm sorry. Does it ache bad?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Nelly held down her head and
began to cry. She was very
much frightened at what she
had done.</p>

<p>"Frankie," said his mother,
"you may go down with Hitty
to the cook, and ask her for a
piece of cake for the little girl.
Then you may walk with her as
far as your teacher's, and wait
till I come. Hitty, you may go
home and tell your mother I
shall bring Nelly there soon, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
have her say what punishment
so naughty a girl deserves."</p>

<p>"O, don't, aunty! don't take
me there! I'm afraid to go!"
sobbed Nelly, catching hold of
her aunt.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Mrs. Gray,
gravely.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do
with me?" asked the child, in
an agony of fear.</p>

<p>"I am going to talk with you,
and I wish you to tell me how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
this dreadful thing occurred. O
Nelly, I can't tell you how very
grieved I am, that you should
do so! I thought you had conquered
your bad temper, and
had become a lovely, amiable
child."</p>

<p>The tears stood in Mrs. Gray's
eyes, and her voice trembled as
she spoke. Nelly sobbed as if
her heart would break; but as
her aunt waited for her to reply,
she said, "I am sorry, aunty. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
didn't mean to hurt her so;
but I didn't want her to touch
Frankie's things."</p>

<p>"Why not? I am sure it was
kind of her to pick up his scarf."</p>

<p>Nelly covered her burning face
with her hands.</p>

<p>"Tell me the truth, my child,"
said her aunt, firmly.</p>

<p>"She is so poor," whispered
Nelly. "I don't like poor girls;
and then she lives in such an
old house."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Nelly!" exclaimed the
lady, "I can hardly believe you
have so proud and wicked a
heart. Suppose your father
should lose all his property, and
you should be obliged to go to
the poorhouse, and wear an old,
shabby dress; should you think
that was a good reason why
another little girl, whom God
had blessed with a good home
and kind friends, delighting to
supply her with the comforts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
of life, should treat you unkindly?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, aunty! I did
not think how very wicked I
was." Then Nelly confessed
truthfully all the naughty feelings
which had made her so unkind
to the new scholar, though
she sobbed so much that she
could hardly speak.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray talked a long time
with her, explaining where her
sin lay; first, in cherishing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
pride, and then in giving way
to anger, which was the very
spirit of Cain when he killed his
brother. After this they knelt
down together; and Nelly, in a
voice broken with weeping, asked
God to forgive her great sin,
and help her to be a good
child.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>NELLY AT MRS. MORAN'S.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Come</span>, now, my dear," said
the lady, putting on her bonnet;
"we must go to Mrs. Moran's
and inquire about Hitty."</p>

<p>"I am afraid to," screamed
Nelly, clinging to her aunt. "O,
I am sure I shall never do so
again! I don't dare to go there."</p>

<p>"Why, Nelly?" asked her
aunt, pitying her distress. "If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
any little girl had injured you
so, I should think it was a very
small thing for her to do, to
come and say she was sorry, and
ask your forgiveness. You are
really sorry, I think. It is but
right you should tell her so."</p>

<p>As they approached the house
the poor child seemed in such an
agony of fear, that her aunt was
obliged to soothe her to lead her
on. Her conscience told her she
had been unkind, even cruel, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
her companion, who had in no
way injured her, and she feared
Hitty's father and mother would
be very angry.</p>

<p>Mr. Moran lived in the upper
part of a building which had
once been used as a shop. A
pair of wide stairs went up outside
the house to the door, which
opened into their room. A man
was at work chopping wood at
the foot of the stairs, and as
soon as Nelly saw him she ran<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
behind her aunt, whispering,
"O, I dare not go! that's Hitty's
father."</p>

<p>"I will take care of you," answered
the lady, knocking at the
door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Moran presently opened
it, and they saw Hitty sitting on
a low stool, playing with the
baby, who was cooing and crowing
with delight at having her
back again.</p>

<p>"I have come," said Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Gray, "with my little niece, who
injured your daughter at school.
She wishes to ask you to forgive
her."</p>

<p>Nelly was crying bitterly, so
that she could scarcely speak;
but at last she sobbed out, "I
didn't mean to hurt her so. I'm
very sorry."</p>

<p>"Don't cry, pet!" said Mrs.
Moran, kindly. "I dare say you
meant her no harm; and if you
did, sure and we all are in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
wrong sometimes. Hitty lays
up nothing against you. There,
honey, stop a bit, and she'll tell
you the same. Come, Hitty, tell
the little girl you forgive her,
since the lady is so kind as
to ask it."</p>

<p>Hitty came forward with Bobby
still in her arms, and when
Nelly held out her hand, shook
it cordially, saying, "My head is
almost well now, and by to-morrow
I'll never think of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
blow again. I'm sorry for you,
Nelly, to see you crying so."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray sat for a time talking
with Mrs. Moran, and encouraging
her to allow Hitty to learn
to read. There was one little
boy just Frankie's age, whom the
lady advised her to send to the
public school.</p>

<p>This, the poor woman said,
she should be glad to do, if the
lad had clothes.</p>

<p>The next day, when Hitty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
returned from school, Nelly,
Frankie, and Ponto accompanied
her, each of them carrying a
bundle as large as they could
lift, with dresses, jackets, and
sacks, the children had outgrown.</p>

<p>Mrs. Moran hardly knew how
to express her gratitude, as she
held up one article after another,
and saw how nicely they would
fit Ned or others among her children.</p>

<p>This lesson, though severe at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the time, was never forgotten by
Nelly. After this no one was
more eager than she to show
kindness to Hitty, or more
pleased when the poor girl succeeded
in learning to read.</p>

<p>In the afternoon most of the
scholars repeated a hymn which
they had learned at home, or a
few verses from the Bible. Nelly
noticed that Hitty never repeated
any, and one day asked
her the reason.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"I haven't any books," answered
the child, "and then I
couldn't make out the hard
words, you know."</p>

<p>Nelly looked thoughtful for a
minute, and then jumped up and
down in her glee. "Ask your
mother to let you come to
aunty's to-night, or else come
early to school and stop there
to-morrow," she cried, "and I
will teach you one of my pretty
songs."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Two days later, when Miss
Grant said, "Now we will hear
the hymns or verses," Hitty, with
a timid air and a blushing face,
took her stand on the floor.
She cast a glance at Nelly,
whose whole countenance was
glowing with pleasure, and then
repeated the following pretty
hymn:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Who was that, dear mamma, who ate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Her breakfast here this morn?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With tangled hair and ragged shoes,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And gown and apron torn?'</span><br />
<br />
'They call her lazy Jane, my dear;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">She begs her bread all day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And gets a lodging in the barn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">At night, among the hay.</span><br />
<br />
'For when she was a little girl,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">She loved her play too well;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">At school she would not mind her book,</span><br />

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FRANKIE AND THE CRIPPLE.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> evening, near the close of
the term, Nelly walked home in
company with one of her schoolmates,
and did not notice that her
cousin went another way. One,
two hours passed by, and Frankie
did not make his appearance;
and at last his mother became
so anxious, that she sent his
brother out to search for him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Willie went to the square to
see whether he had stopped at
any of the stores, then, as he
did not find him, to the houses
of some of his schoolmates, but
none of them had seen him since
school.</p>

<p>"Where can he have gone?"
said Willie to himself. "Perhaps
he was at his teacher's, and
has returned before this time."</p>

<p>He walked back toward home,
looking around on every side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>He was passing a house, when
he heard a noise in the yard, and
looking through the trees, saw a
company of boys standing round
a curious little carriage, in which
sat a boy who was talking to
them. He ran eagerly into the
yard, for he thought Frankie was
among them.</p>

<p>As he drew nearer, he found
it was not a boy in the carriage,
but a man without legs. He had
met with a dreadful accident, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
been obliged to have both his
legs cut off; and now he was
trying to support himself by selling
pictures, rolling himself in
his carriage from house to house
by means of a crank wheel. This
was very hard work for him, especially
when he was going uphill;
sometimes he was obliged
to get boys to push behind.</p>

<p>Willie saw his brother Frankie
standing by the man, helping him
hold his pictures, which he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
exhibiting to the lady at the window.
Frankie's face was very
red, and great drops of perspiration
stood on his forehead and
nose.</p>

<p>"Why haven't you been
home?" asked Willie. "Mother
is very anxious about you."</p>

<p>"O, Willie, see this poor man!"
exclaimed Frankie. "I have been
pushing his wagon for him ever
since school. He says he is a
cripple, and can't walk at all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
I'm going to push his carriage
home now, as soon as he has sold
pictures here, and then ask mamma
to give him some supper."</p>

<p>"Why, Frankie Gray," called
out the lady at the window, "is
that you? Well, come and take
this money, dear, to pay for three
pictures."</p>

<p>When the carriage started, the
boys all ran along; but none of
them offered to assist in rolling
it, except Willie and Frankie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are tired," said Willie;
"I'll push now." So Frankie
took off his straw hat, and wiped
the perspiration from his forehead.
His hair was wet through,
and curled in small rings all over
his head.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray was looking anxiously
from the window when
they entered the avenue, and
ran eagerly down to meet them.</p>

<p>"O, mamma!" cried Frankie;
"I met a poor man. He has no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
legs, and can't walk at all. He
has to wheel himself about in a
little carriage, to get enough
money to buy his food. It's
very hard work, and so I waited
to push it for him a little while.
Was it naughty, mamma? Will
you please to give him some
supper?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray looked in her son's
earnest, loving eyes, and all her
displeasure against him vanished.
She caught him to her heart, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
kissed his cheek and lips. "Yes,
my dear," she said, "you shall
have the pleasure of giving him
a good supper. But are you not
hungry yourself? It is long past
tea time."</p>

<p>"I did not think any thing
about it, mamma," said Frankie,
"I was so sorry for the poor
man. There, Willie has pushed
his carriage up to the back door.
I wonder how he can get out."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
cripple had walked on his knees
to the table, where Jane had set
him a bountiful meal. Frankie
seemed to consider the man his
especial charge, and Mrs. Gray
drew Willie into the entry,
where, through the door, they
could see what passed.</p>

<p>As soon as the food was before
him, the cripple began to
eat; and Frankie, who was
seated opposite, so as to be
ready to attend to his wants,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
gazed at him in great surprise.
"Why!" said he, "you didn't
pray to God."</p>

<p>I suppose the dear child had
never before seen any one begin
to eat without first asking a blessing.
Even when he and Nelly
were playing tea, one of them
always shut their eyes, and solemnly
asked God to bless the
food.</p>

<p>The man stared at him and
went on eating, while Mrs. Gray<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
smiled as she peeped through the
door, to see how serious the boy
looked.</p>

<p>"Don't you love God?" asked
Frankie.</p>

<p>"I dun know," said the man.</p>

<p>"I love him," continued the
child, "and I should think you
would;" then, after waiting a
moment, he asked, "Did he cut
your legs off?"</p>

<p>"No," said the man, laughing;
"the doctor did it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm glad of that," said Frankie.
"You ought to love God, and pray
to him every day. Perhaps, if you
did, he would let your legs grow
again."</p>

<p>Willie almost laughed aloud;
but Frankie was so eager to do
the man good, that he did not
hear him.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are a wicked
man," he said, "if you don't pray
any."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray saw the cripple lay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
down his knife and fork, and
gaze at the child; presently he
spoke, but his voice trembled as
he said, "I used to pray when I
was a little shaver like you. My
mother taught me."</p>

<p>"Where is she now?" asked
the boy.</p>

<p>"She has gone up there, long
ago," said the man, softly pointing
his finger upward.</p>

<p>"Well," said Frankie, earnestly,
"you can't go to heaven and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
live with her there, unless you
are a good man and love God.
I used to be naughty once, but
my mother whipped me to make
me good."</p>

<p>"That's too bad," said the
cripple.</p>

<p>"No; it's just right. The
Bible says she must. I'm trying
now to be a good boy; and
I wish you would try too."</p>

<p>"I guess there isn't much danger
of you," said the man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
"You're the most wonderful
chap I ever saw."</p>

<p>"I don't know what <i>chap</i> is,"
replied Frankie. "When I say
my prayers to-night, I am going
to ask God to give you a new
heart; and then you can't help
being good."</p>

<p>"I wish you would," whispered
the man, drawing his shirt
sleeve across his eyes.</p>

<p>He pushed his chair back from
the table, saying, "I've had a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
first-rate supper; and I thank
you and your mother a thousand
times for all your kindness."</p>

<p>Willie then stepped into the
kitchen, and helped him from
his chair into his carriage, at
the back door. The man gave
Frankie two of his handsomest
pictures, saying, "Don't forget
what you promised to do for me
to-night. I have nobody else to
pray for me now."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE RAINY DAY.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Miss Grant</span> gave her scholars
Wednesday and Saturday afternoons
for play.</p>

<p>One Wednesday morning it
rained very hard; and as Nelly
was not quite well, her aunt
thought it not best for her to
go to school. Margie too had
been unwell for a few days;
so Mrs. Gray sent for her to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
come up to the nursery, that
they might amuse themselves
with their dolls.</p>

<p>Margie was eleven years of age;
but she liked to play as well as
ever. She had Frankie's black
Dinah for her child; and then
she had a large rag baby of her
own, while Nelly had great Fanny
and two smaller dolls.</p>

<p>These they set up in a row,
and played school; but just as
they were ready to begin, Ponto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
walked into the room, and tipped
the scholars over.</p>

<p>"O Ponto, how naughty!"
exclaimed Nelly, laughing aloud,
as he carefully stepped over the
pupils, who were lying on their
faces. "Now let us begin
again."</p>

<p>So Dinah, and Fanny, and Lily
Gray, and Jenny, Margie's doll,
were all placed in nice order
again, their backs up against the
wall; and after a few words,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
charging the scholars to be very
good and say their lessons well,
Nelly rang her aunt's small table
bell, for them to take their places
in the class.</p>

<p>But not one of the dollies
stirred; and so Nelly took Dinah's
hand, and led her out to
the floor.</p>

<p>They played in this way for
more than an hour, and then
Nelly complained of the headache;
and so her aunt sent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
her to lie down and rest till
dinner.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Frankie had
put on his India rubber boots,
and holding a large umbrella,
started off for school, as happy
as possible. He had never been
absent or tardy a single day;
and his teacher had promised
to paint him a beautiful card,
if he continued his good conduct
to the end of the term.</p>

<p>The dear boy was very much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
pleased at this, and was trying
in every way to be good. He
trudged gayly on right through
the puddles of water, the rain
pattering upon his umbrella, and
dripping off upon the ground.</p>

<p>"I don't care," said Frankie
to himself. "It's hard walking,
I know; but I shall have a good
time when I get there. My
teacher will say, 'I knew you
would be here, Frankie, because
you belong to the Try Company.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>When he reached the schoolroom,
he found no one there but
his teacher and Hitty; and how
do you think they came so safely
in all the rain? Frankie laughed
most heartily when they told him.
They rode with the butcher in
his covered cart.</p>

<p>They had kindled a nice fire
in the open grate, and after the
little fellow had stamped off the
mud in the porch, he came in
and stood by it to dry himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>The clock struck nine; but
not one more of the scholars
came, because it was only a half
day, the teacher said; and so
Frankie and Hitty stood before
her, instead of going on the gallery,
and repeated the Lord's
Prayer.</p>

<p>Then she told them to bring
their chairs close to the fire.</p>

<p>"What a funny little school!"
said Frankie, laughing.</p>

<p>The teacher laughed too, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
said, "I think we shall have a
very pleasant time." She rang
the bell, and Frankie marched
out alone to his class. Then she
rung it again, and Hitty read
and spelt. She could read quite
well now, and was getting to be
a very good scholar.</p>

<p>After this, Miss Grant said, "I
must march with you, I suppose;"
and so she stepped upon
the circle; and they marched
around and around, singing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
"This is the way we wash our face,"<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>the teacher washing hers as hard
as any of them.</div>

<p>At recess she took a piece of
paper from her desk, and drew
a pretty picture of a dog carrying
a basket in his mouth, and
told Frankie to draw one like it.</p>

<p>Frankie was delighted, and
said, "This dog is like Ponto,
only that it has a short tail instead
of a long one."</p>

<p>Miss Grant then cut a paper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
doll for Hitty, and afterward
one for Nelly. She made paper
dresses, and aprons, and capes,
and paper hats for their heads;
and was so much engaged when
she saw how delighted the children
were, that she forgot she
was teaching school, and never
rang the bell for the close of
recess for more than an hour.</p>

<p>They all laughed merrily, and
Frankie, clapping his hands, said,
"I like rainy days best of all!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>After recess, Miss Grant gave
the children a lesson in geography,
and then related a story of
a boy, named Charles Huntington,
who, by his honesty, uprightness,
and faithfulness to his employer,
became a great and good
man. Having gained wealth, he
gave freely of it to the poor and
needy, and, after a long life of
happiness and usefulness, died
lamented by all who knew him.</p>

<p>Frankie listened attentively to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the story, and then said, "I'm
going to ask God to help me be
like Mr. Charles Huntington."</p>

<p>And here we must leave our
young friend, with the hope that
the promise of early youth was
verified in his manhood; that the
seed sown in his young and tender
heart, and watered by his
mother's tearful prayers, sprang
up and bore abundant fruit.</p>

<p>As for his cousin Nelly, she
continued with her aunt for many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
years, until her mother died, when
she returned home to comfort
and bless her father, and help
train her little brother as she
had herself been taught by her
kind friends. She always entertained
for Frankie the deep affection
of a sister; and when he
graduated from college with the
first honors of his class, no one
rejoiced or felt more proud of
his success than his cousin Nelly.</p>
